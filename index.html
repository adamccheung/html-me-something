            <p>The 2011 season got off to a rough start when ace Adam Wainwright injured his elbow on February 23rd. The injury required surgery and would cost him the entire season.</p>

      <h3>Regular Season</h3>
       <p>The first half of the season was up and down for St. Louis. They were lucky to be tied for the NL Central lead heading into the All Star break. Things got worse after the break, they started to lose ground to the Milwaukee Brewers. For the month of July, they went 13-13 posting two separate three-game losing streaks and never winning more than three games in a row. The Cards struggled through the better part of August. After August 24th, they had a 10-12 record for the month and found themselves ten games back of the Brewers. They were also 10.5 games behind the Atlanta Braves in the Wild Card standings, and their chance of being a part of the postseason was dismal. This is the point that can be considered the start of their amazing comeback. They won five of the remaining six games in August and marched into September having swept the Brewers in a three game series at Milwaukee. The Redbirds entered the final month of the season sitting 8.5 games behind the Brewers in the Central and 8.5 behind the Braves in the Wild Card standings. That left them 28 games to try to get back in the race(s). Essentially they would need to play tremendous ball and hope that one of the two teams somehow falter down the stretch. Sometimes it is easier to play better baseball when there is nothing truly left to lose and everything to gain. So, the Cardinals went about their business. They won 20 games while the Braves went in the complete opposite direction. On the last day of the season, the Cardinals got an excellent pitching performance from Chris Carpenter en route to a 8-0 win. Maybe destiny was on their side as the Braves lost a 13 inning heart breaker to the Philadelphia Phillies giving the Cardinals their ticket to the postseason.</p>

       <h3>Postseason</h3>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/tqgB_ibBJBkcgs-DxbtheEih5pOrI5l-tfIOfYxiGgacVhxOVbAQ8xGVi5zcAGfz6IuIMJKsySPEk4KGd1NkguGIOR2qb0TkKG9zdw2pR0NX17YmFSQajk11UjUsr_w">
       <p>Beginning with the NL Division Series against the heavily favored Philadelphia Phillies, the Cardinals were led by Albert Pujols who hit .350. Chris Carpenter sealed the series win with a dominant 3-hit shutout pitching against Philliesâ€™ ace Roy Halladay. In the NL Championship Series, the Cards faced off against a familiar foe, the NL Central Champion, Milwaukee Brewers.The Cardinals beat the Brewers 4 games to 2 and the storybook season would see one more chapter written.Since the National League won the MLB All-Star game, the Cardinals had home-field advantage for the World Series against the Texas Rangers. Heading into game 6, the Cardinals were down 3 games to 2 in the best of 7 series.  Entering the top of the seventh inning the game was tied at 4. Lance Lynn entered the game and promptly let up back to back home runs to Adrian Beltre and Nelson Cruz. The Rangers tacked on another run to make it 7-4. The Cardinals failed to score in the bottom half of the seventh and the Rangers did not score in the top half of the eighth. With one out in the bottom of the eighth Allen Craig homered to cut the Ranger lead to 2. Jason Motte held the Rangers scoreless in the ninth. The rest will go done in St. Louis Cardinals lore for years to come.In the bottom of the ninth, Pujols hit a one-out double, Lance Berkman walked and Allen Craig then struck out. Freese, with a 1-2 count tripled to deep right field scoring Pujols and Berkman. The emotional high turned into dejection quickly as Motte let up a one-out single to Elvis Andrus and then Josh Hamilton hit a two-run homer to give the Rangers the lead at 9-7. The Cardinals received back to back singles from Daniel Descalso and Jon Jay to open the tenth. Kyle Lohse came on and laid down a sacrifice bunt moving the runners to second and third. Ryan Theriot grounded out scoring Descalso. Up came Berkman, and again down to their final strike, he lined a single to center scoring the tying run. Jake Westbrook pitched a scoreless eleventh for the Cards. The Rangers sent Mark Lowe to the mound to face the hottest hitter on either side, Freese. On a 3-2 count, Freese homered to deep center winning the game. Game 7 was much less dramatic as the Cardinals finished off the Rangers with a 6-2 win, sealing their 11th World Series Title.</p>
